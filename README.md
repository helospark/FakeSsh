#Fake SSH
A fake SSH service that pretends to be a legit, but logs all usernames, passwords, someone tries to authenticate.
I made it to investigate brute-force attack on SSH services.

It was written in Java, using Spring for DI and Maven to get the dependencies.

At the moment the development is still inprogress...
